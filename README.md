##What's this?
It's seriously an easy way to get your Facebook tab app done quickly. If you have no idea on how to get started and want a quick, easy way to get it done, this is it.

##How do I set it up?
Set all the variables in the **includes/config.php** (don't worry, there's documentation there).
	
Install the tab on your actual page by going to the Sproutly installation URL and add a ***?install*** to the end of the URL. For example: http://domain.com/sproutly/?install

##How do I setup my fangate page?
Edit the **"page-unliked.php"** file. That's the page that gets shown to users who have yet to like your tab.
	
##How do I get users who liked my page something?
Edit the **"page-liked.php"** file. That's the page that gets shown to users who have liked your page.
	
##Does this auto set the height of the tab?
Yep. Sure does. It's been tested ;).
